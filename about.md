Ever thought your editor experience was too quiet?
Ever needed some funky music to boost your energy, or some calm music to help you focus on level building?
Hate editing in music in post, or want to liven your livestream?

Well do I have the mod for you!

This just adds music to the editor, which pauses when playtesting and shuffles through your music randomly. Place your .mp3, .wav or .ogg files in your config directory (press ![the settings button](frame:geode.loader/settings.png?scale=0.375) then ![the mod save folder button](undefined0.editormusic/geode-folder.png?scale=0.6)), or use a custom directory!


## This mod has recently had a complete rewrite! If you see some missing features, this is most likely why. They will be added eventually!
Please report any bugs as a result to me either through the github or through the geode discord server. If the mod crashes on startup, check there are only a-z and 0-9 characters in the song name, artist name, album cover description and path of the song!
