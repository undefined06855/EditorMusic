Ever thought your editor experience was too quiet?
Ever needed some funky music to boost your energy, or some calm music to help you focus on level building?
Hate editing in music in post, or want to liven your livestream?

Well do I have the mod for you!

This just adds music to the editor, which pauses when playtesting and shuffles through your music randomly. Place your .mp3, .wav or .ogg files in your config directory (press ![the settings button](frame:geode.loader/settings.png?scale=0.375) then ![the mod save folder button](undefined0.editormusic/geode-folder.png?scale=0.6)), or use a custom directory!


This mod has Rift label support! Use `{currentEditorSong}`, `{currentEditorSongArtist}`, `{editorSongDuration}` and `{editorSongTimestamp}` in your Eclipse Discord RPC or labels today!
